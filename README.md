# Terraform AWS

This document provides an overview of using Terraform to provision resources in AWS.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- An AWS account
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- AWS CLI configured with your AWS credentials

## Getting Started

To begin using Terraform with AWS, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository containing your Terraform configuration files.
2. Navigate to the directory where your Terraform files are located.
3. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory.
4. Create a new Terraform configuration file (e.g., `main.tf`) and define your AWS resources.
5. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes that will be made or `terraform show -json plan.out > plan.json` to save the report to a json file.
6. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and provision the resources in AWS. You can also run `terraform apply "plan.out"` to using plan file ran before to save time.

## Best Practices

When working with Terraform and AWS, consider the following best practices:

- Use version control to track changes to your Terraform configuration files.
- Separate your Terraform code into modules for reusability and maintainability.
- Use variables and input files to make your configuration more flexible.
- Use Terraform workspaces to manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, production).
- Regularly review and update your Terraform code to reflect changes in your infrastructure.

## Conclusion

Terraform provides a powerful and flexible way to provision and manage resources in AWS. By following best practices and leveraging the capabilities of Terraform, you can effectively automate your infrastructure deployment process.
